|Unit Tests Status (click): |[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/floswald/migration.svg?token=yCXmyQ4r4F8RyxxzHZFG&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/floswald/migration) |

This is the replication kit for *The Effect of Homeownership on the Option Value of Regional Migration*, forthcoming in [Quantitative Economics](http://qeconomics.org).

# Software Requirements

1. `julia` version [0.6.x (*not* the latest version of julia)](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases.html) is needed to replicate all results from section 3 onwards in the paper.
2. `R` at least version `3.5` for results in chapter 2 and if you want to rebuild the data inputs to the julia package.
3. `git` (optional, but useful. In general `;-)`)

# Installation Instructions



## Installing `julia` Package `mig`

All results from the structural model are produced with the package `mig`, which is a sub-folder of this repository. Here is how to install it.

1. In order to use the code, you should clone this repository to your computer by typing in your terminal

    ```bash
    # I refer to where you want this on your computer as MIGJL
    # `MIGJL` is only an example. 
    cd MIGJL  
    git clone https://github.com/floswald/migration.git
    ```
    or you manually download the source code as a zip folder from [here](https://github.com/floswald/migration/releases/tag/v1.0). 

1. Go to where you cloned the package to, e.g. `MIGJL`.
2. We'll call `julia6` the julia v0.6.x executable you installed above, in order to comply with the [software requirements](#software-requirements). Type this in your terminal:
    
    ```
    julia6 mig/install.jl
    ```
    to download all dependencies and precompile the package.

3. Given the non-standard structure of this repo, the above script tries to *sym link* directory `MIGJL/mig/` into your standard julia package directory at `~/.julia/v0.6` with unix command `ln -s`. This may not work on a windows machine, but [I found this for you to try yourself](https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-symbolic-links-windows10/).
4. Run `julia6 -e 'Pkg.test("mig")';` to run the unit tests on your computer.
5. Observe that the (green!) badge on top of this README indicates that the same tests run on MacOS and Linux on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/floswald/migration).

## Installing `R` package `migR`

The easiest way to deal with dependencies is to directly install from github with this command issued in an `R` session:

```R
library(devtools)  # install `devtools` if not installed.
install_github("floswald/migR")
```

Alternatively, you can install the package using `RStudio`, but you need to make sure yourself that all dependencies are installed. Download the [migR_1.0.tar.gz package](https://github.com/floswald/migR/releases/tag/1.0) and install as described.

# Replication Instructions

This section describes how to replicate all results in the paper. 

## Replication Hierarchy

Results in the main text are numbered in standard latin (1,2,...) whereas results in the [online appendix](https://floswald.github.io/pdf/homeownership-appendix.pdf) are prefixed by a section letter (A.1, A.2,...). There are several levels at which a replication exericse could start, related to how much of the input data one wants to take as given. The structure of this could be illustrated in the following way:

```
    +-----------------------------------+
    |                                   |
    |          migR R package           |
    |                                   |
    +-----------------------------------+
                 |    |    |
                 |    |    |
              uses and processes
                 |    |    |
                 |    |    |
        <--------+    v    +--------->

SIPP micro data   FHFA Indices    BEA Income Series       Level 1
                      |
                      |    
                   outputs
                      |    
          <-----------+----------->
 
   Motivating Results       Data Moments                  Level 2
     chapter 2                      |
                                    |
                                    v
                       +-------------------------+
                       |    mig julia package    |
                       +-------------------------+
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    v
                            Results chapters 3+           Level 3
```

As it is probably most relevant for many users, I will start at the highest `Level 3`, taking all input data as given, then move down the chain.

## Level 3 Replication

This level uses the pre-built input datasets in `MIGJL/mig/in` to run the structural model. The simplest interface is to use the run file which you can launch on your command line in directory `MIGJL/mig` as follows:

```bash
> cd MIGJL/mig
> julia6 run.jl --help

The Effect of Homeownership on the Option
Value of Regional Migration (Oswald, 2019)

    | Welcome to the run file of my paper. Please
    | see below how to run the code. 
    | Thanks,
    | Florian

Usage:
    run.jl -h | --help
    run.jl --version
    run.jl estim (bgp|grad|slices|stderrors|thomas) [--nworkers=<nw>] [--maxiter=<maxit>][--npoints=<npts>]  
    run.jl test 
    run.jl experiment (elasticity|ownersWTP|ownersWTP2|moneyMC|decomp) [--nworkers=<nw>] [--shock=<sh>] [--nosave]  [--neg]
    run.jl experiment moversWTP [--nworkers=<nw>] [--nosave] [--region=<reg>] 
    run.jl experiment noMove [--yshock=<ys>] [--pshock=<ps>] [--nosave] [--nworkers=<nw>] 
    run.jl experiment scenarios [--nworkers=<nw>] [--nosave]

    --neg               perform negative elasticity shock. If you set it, it does negative.
    --shock=<sh>        type of shock to apply [default: q]
    --yshock=<ys>       shock applied to regional income [default: 1.0]
    --pshock=<ps>       shock applied to regional price [default: 1.0]
    --version           show version



```

### Section 5.3: Parameter Estimates and Moments

#### Table 8: Parameter Estimates

You perform estimation of the model by running

```
julia6 run.jl estim grad
```

optionally specifying the number of workers desired. Standard errors are subsequently obtained by running

```
julia6 run.jl estim stderrors
```

#### Figures 4 and D.1 and tables D.1 and D.2

The fit of the model is illustrated by comparing model and data moments. You can write a table to this extent to disk by running in a `julia6` session

```julia
> julia6
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  A fresh approach to technical computing
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org

julia> using mig

julia> runObj(printm = true)   

```
 
The figures are then created with function [`plot_moment_fit`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/plot_moment_fit.html) in `R` package `migR`.

### Section 6.1: Elasticities with respect to Regional Shocks

#### Tables 9 and E.1

```bash
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment elasticity --nworkers=9
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment elasticity --nworkers=9 --shock=p
```

Users may find it helpful to refer to script `MIGJL/replicate-AWS.sh` to see how I ran this on an [AWS cluster built with cfncluster](https://floswald.github.io/html/cluster.html).

### Section 6.2: Why Do Owners Move Less?

Table 10 is created by running 

```bash
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment decomp
```


### Section 6.3: Owner Regret

Table 12 is created by running:

```bash
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment ownersWTP2 --nworkers=9
```

### Section 6.4: The value of Migration

Table 11 is created by running:

```bash
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment noMove --nworkers=9
```

Version 2 and 3 of that experiment, i.e. tables E.11 and E.12 in the online appendix are similarly created with

```bash
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment noMove --nworkers=9 --yshock=0.99 --pshock=0.99
julia6 --color=yes run.jl experiment noMove --nworkers=9 --yshock=0.95 --pshock=0.9
```

Figures 5 and 6, along with several other figures, can be created, after running the above experiments, by doing in a julia6 session

```julia
julia> using mig

julia> n = mig.read_noMove()   # reads baseline version (table 11)

julia> mig.plot_noMove(n)  

```


### Section E.2 Comparative Statics of a Regional Price Shock

The tables in that section can be reproduced by running

```bash
julia6 run.jl experiment scenarios --nworkers=9
```


## Level 2 Replication

This section is concerned with code in a different repository at [https://github.com/floswald/migR](https://github.com/floswald/migR). 

This replication level is taking as given the input data in folder `data/` of the [`migR` package](https://github.com/floswald/migR). The package help manual with function reference is available as a [pdf](https://github.com/floswald/migR/blob/master/migR_1.0.pdf) at the root of the package or online as a [searchable website](https://floswald.github.io/migR). 

You can obtain all code and prebuilt data on the commandline with

```
git clone https://github.com/floswald/migR.git
```

or by downloading the precompiled package as [described above](#installing-r-package-migr)

### Chapter 2 Tables and Figures

To replicate, you would invoke `R` and load the package with

```R

```

#### Table 2

With the package loaded as above, you get table 2 with function [`CPS.distance`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/CPS.distance.html)


#### Table 3

Function [`Sipp.SumStats`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Sipp.SumStats.html).

#### Table 4

Function [`SippProbitMove`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/SippProbitMove.html).

#### Figure 1

Function [`PlotSippMigrationRates`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/PlotSippMigrationRates.html).

#### Figure 2

Function [`correlograms`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/correlograms.html).


### Section 5.1: Estimation of Exogenous Processes and Moment Generation

To parametrize the structural model, several processes need to be estimated first. This section describes the functions in charge of this task.


#### Tables 5, B.4 and Figures 3, B.3, B.1 and B.2

This is produced by function [`Export.VAR`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Export.VAR.html)

#### Table 6

This is produced by function [`both_prices_output`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/both_prices_output.html)

#### Income Process

Table and figure C.1 are produced by function [`Export.IncomeProcess`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Export.IncomeProcess.html)


#### Estimation of Movers' Copula

Figures C.2 and C.3 as well as Table C.2 is produced by [`Sipp.wage_residual_copulas`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Sipp.wage_residual_copulas.html)

#### Creation of Moments

Function [`Sipp.moments`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Sipp.moments.html) returns a data.table with data moments.

#### Exporting All Inputs for `julia`

Function [`Export.Julia`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Export.Julia.html) writes all relevant data to disk in `.rda` format.



## Level 1 Replication

### SIPP Download

This is the lowest level i.e. it starts with SIPP data acquisition. I used code previously published at [ajdamico/asdfree](https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree), but it has since evolved. I have a fork the previous version, however, and so the process starts with this:

1. `git clone https://github.com/floswald/asdfree`
2. `cd asdfree/SIPP`
3. uncommenting as warranted, execute scripts `downxxxx.R`.

### SIPP Extraction

Once the SIPP database is created locally, we can extract data from it. The function is [`Extract.wrap`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/Extract.wrap.html).

### FHFA and BEA download

Functions [`get_BEA_persincome`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/get_BEA_persincome.html) and [`download.FHFA`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/download.FHFA.html) get the macro data series. Notice that [`get_BEA_persincome`](https://floswald.github.io/migR/reference/get_BEA_persincome.html) depends on external package [EconData](https://github.com/floswald/EconData)
