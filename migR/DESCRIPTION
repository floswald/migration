Description: This R package serves two purposes: First, to process raw data 
    and summarise it so that it can be use as input to the structural model 
    presented in Oswald (2019). Second, the package produces a set of stylized
    facts from the same raw data which are used to motivate the entire
    exercise. The package can be used as is, in the sense that I ship the
    final data products. Users interested in replicating the data acquisition
    and cleaning steps, need to follow further instructions to obtain SIPP
    raw data. This step is documented within the package.
